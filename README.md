## Dependencies

FFmpeg (on Windows) is required for the music to play.

1. Go to https://ffmpeg.org/download.html, scroll down to "More downloading options" -> "Get packages & executable files".
2. Download the executable file from one of the sources. (I used Windows builds from gyan.dev -> ffmpeg-git-essentials.7z)
3. Unzip the file to get a directory.
4. Right click on the Windows icon, go to Settings -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables.
5. In the "System variables" section, double click on "Path".
6. In the directory from step 3, there should be a "bin" directory. Add it to Path. Remember to confirm your changes.
7. Restart the terminal for it to take effect.

### Introduction

This is a rhythm game where the player press buttons at the correct timing according to the music.

The QWEIOP keys are used as controls.

Currently, there is only 1 song: "Brain Power" by NOMA.

It is impossible to adjust the timing setting for now.
