## Notes

To install the dependencies, I developed the project on Ubuntu using my personal Windows system.
I installed mpg123 for the music playing feature.
If the project failed to compile, try installing mpg123 (around 4 MB):
```console
$ sudo apt install mpg123
```

### Introduction

This is a rhythm game where the player press buttons at the correct timing according to the music.
The QWEIOP keys are used as controls.
Currently, there is only 1 song: "Brain Power" by NOMA.
It is impossible to adjust the timing setting for now.
